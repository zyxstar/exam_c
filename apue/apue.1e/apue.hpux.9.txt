These are hints sent to me by a reader who successfully compiled
the library under HP-UX 9.04.

In addition to the things mentioned in the README file:
     
1) Start with the base of lib.svr4/.
     
2) Additional compiler options (-Ae -D_HPUX_SOURCE):
	cc -O -Ae -D_HPUX_SOURCE <file>.c
     
3) All code that needs stropts.h or poll.h should be omitted.
